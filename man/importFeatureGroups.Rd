\usage{
importFeatureGroups(path, type, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path that should be used for importing. See the algorithm specific functions for more details.}

\item{type}{Which file type should be imported: \code{"brukerpa"} (Bruker ProfileAnalysis), \code{"brukertasq"}
(Bruker TASQ) or \code{"envimass"} (\pkg{enviMass}).}

\item{\dots}{Further arguments passed to the selected import algorithm function.}

An object of a class which is derived from \code{\link{featureGroups}}.

\description{
Generic function to import feature groups produced by other software from files.
}
\details{
\code{importFeatureGroups} is a generic function that will import feature groups from files by one of the supported algorithms. The actual
  functionality is provided by algorithm specific functions such as \code{importFeatureGroupsBrukerTASQ} and \code{importFeatureGroupsBrukerPA}. While these
  functions may be called directly, \code{importFeatureGroups} provides a generic interface and is therefore usually preferred.

\code{\link{groupFeatures}} to group features. Other import functions:
  \code{\link{importFeatureGroupsXCMS}}, \code{\link{importFeatureGroupsXCMS3}} and
  \code{\link{importFeatureGroupsKPIC2}}.
