\arguments{
\item{fGroups}{The \code{\link{featureGroups}} object that should be used for reporting data.}

\item{path}{The destination file path for files generated during reporting. Will be generated if needed.}

\item{reportFeatures}{If set to \code{TRUE} then for each analysis a
\file{.csv} file will be generated with information about its detected
features.}

\item{formulas, compounds, compsCluster, components}{Further objects (\code{\link{formulas}}, \code{\link{compounds}},
\code{\link{compoundsCluster}}, \code{\link{components}}) that should be reported. Specify \code{NULL} to skip
reporting a particular object.}

\item{compoundsNormalizeScores, formulasNormalizeScores}{A \code{character} that specifies how normalization of
annotation scorings occurs. Either
\code{"none"} (no normalization),
\code{"max"} (normalize to max value) or \code{"minmax"} (perform min-max
normalization). Note that normalization of negative scores (e.g. output by
\command{SIRIUS}) is always performed as min-max. Furthermore, currently
normalization for \code{compounds} takes the original min/max scoring
values into account when candidates were generated. Thus, for
\code{compounds} scoring, normalization is not affected when candidate
results were removed after they were generated (\emph{e.g.} by use of
\code{filter}).}

\item{compoundsExclNormScores, formulasExclNormScores}{A
  \code{character} vector specifying any compound scoring names that
  should \emph{not} be normalized. Set to \code{NULL} to normalize all
  scorings. Note that whether any normalization occurs is set by the
  \code{compoundsExclNormScores,formulasExclNormScores} argument.

  For \code{compounds}: By default \code{score} and
  \code{individualMoNAScore} are set to mimic the behavior of the
  \command{MetFrag} web interface.}

\item{retMin}{If \code{TRUE} then report retention times in minutes (otherwise seconds).}

\item{clearPath}{If \code{TRUE} then the destination path will be (recursively) removed prior to reporting.}

\item{reportFGroups}{If \code{TRUE} then feature group data will be reported.}

\item{formulasTopMost, compoundsTopMost}{Only this amount of top ranked candidate formulae/compounds are reported.
Lower values may significantly speed up reporting. Set to \code{NULL} to ignore.}

\item{reportFormulaSpectra}{If \code{TRUE} then explained MS/MS spectra (if available) for candidate formulae will be
reported. Specifying \code{formulas} and setting this argument to \code{FALSE} still allows further annotation of
compound MS/MS spectra.}

\item{compoundsOnlyUsedScorings}{If \code{TRUE} then only scorings are plotted that actually have been used to rank
data (see the \code{scoreTypes} argument to \code{\link{generateCompoundsMetFrag}} for more details).}

\item{MSPeakLists}{A \code{\link{MSPeakLists}} object that is \emph{mandatory} when spectra for formulae and/or
compounds will be reported.}

\item{EICGrid}{An integer vector in the form \code{c(columns, rows)} that is used to determine the plotting grid when
reporting EICs in PDF files.}

\item{EICParams}{A named \code{list} with parameters used for extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) creation. See the
\link[=EICParams]{EIC parameters} documentation for more details.}

\item{reportPlots}{A character vector specifying what should be plotted. Valid options are: \code{"chord"},
\code{"venn"}, \code{"upset"} (plot a chord, Venn and UpSet diagram, respectively), \code{"eics"} (plot EICs for
individual feature groups) and \code{"formulas"} (plot annotated formula spectra). Set to \code{"none"} to plot
none of these.}

\item{includeMFWebLinks}{A \code{character} specifying to which feature groups a web link should be added in the
annotation page to \href{https://msbi.ipb-halle.de/MetFragBeta/index.xhtml}{MetFragWeb}. Options are:
\code{"compounds"} (only to those with compounds results), \code{"MSMS"} (only to those with MSMS peak lists) or
\code{"none"}.}

\item{interactiveHeat}{If \code{TRUE} an interactive heatmap HTML widget will be generated to display hierarchical
clustering results. Set to \code{FALSE} for a 'regular' static plot.}

\item{specSimParams}{A named \code{list} with parameters that influence the calculation of MS spectra similarities.
See the \link[=specSimParams]{spectral similarity parameters} documentation for more details.}

\item{TPs}{A \code{\link{transformationProducts}} object that should used for plotting hierarchies. Ignored if
\code{TPs=NULL} or \code{components} is not a \code{componentsTPs} object.}

\item{TPGraphStructuresMax}{Maximum number of TP structures to plot in TP hierarchies, see the \code{TPs} argument.
Sets the \code{structuresMax} argument to \code{\link[=plotGraph,featureGroups-method]{plotGraph}}.}

\item{selfContained}{If \code{TRUE} the output will be a standalone HTML file which contains all graphics and script
dependencies. When \code{FALSE}, the latter will be placed in an additional directory (\file{report_files}) which
should remain present when viewing the output file. Especially on Windows, a non-self contained output might be
desirable when reporting large amounts of data to prevent \command{pandoc} from running out of memory.}

\item{optimizePng}{If \code{TRUE} then \command{pngquant} is used to reduce the size of generated graphics. A
significant reduction in disk space usage may be seen, however, at the cost additional processing time. Multiple
\command{pngquant} processes will be executed in parallel, which can be configured with
\option{patRoon.MP.maxProcs} (parallelization will always happen with the \code{"classic"} method, see
\link[=patRoon-package]{patRoon options}).}

\item{openReport}{If set to \code{TRUE} then the output report file will be opened with the system browser.}

\item{noDate}{If \code{TRUE} then the current date is not added to the report. This is mainly used for testing and
its main purpose is to guarantees equal report files when \code{reportHTML()} is called multiple times with equal
arguments.}

\description{
Functionality to report data produced by most workflow steps such as features, feature groups, calculated chemical
formulae and tentatively identified compounds. This is the legacy interface, for the updated interface see
\link{reporting}.
}
\details{
These functions are usually called at the very end of the workflow. It is used to report various data on features and
feature groups. In addition, these functions may be used for reporting formulae and/or compounds that were generated
for the specified feature groups. Data can be reported in tabular form (\emph{i.e.} \file{.csv} files) by
\code{reportCSV} or graphically by \code{reportPDF} and \code{reportHTML}. The latter functions will plot for
instance chromatograms and annotated mass spectra, which are useful to get a graphical overview of results.

All functions have a wide variety of arguments that influence the reporting process. Nevertheless, most parameters
are optional and only required to be given for fine tuning. In addition, only those objects (\emph{e.g.} formulae,
compounds, clustering) that are desired to be reported need to be specified.

\code{reportCSV} generates tabular data (\emph{i.e.} \file{.csv}
  files) for given data to be reported. This may also be useful to allow
  import by other tools for post processing.

\code{reportPDF} will report graphical data (\emph{e.g.} chromatograms and mass spectra) within PDF files.
  Compared to \code{reportHTML} this function may be faster and yield smaller report files, however, its
  functionality is a bit more basic and generated data is more 'scattered' around.

\code{reportHTML} will report graphical data (\emph{e.g.} chromatograms and mass spectra) and summary
  information in an easy browsable \code{HTML} file using \link{rmarkdown}, \link{flexdashboard} and \link{knitr}.
}
\note{
Any formulae and compounds for feature groups which are not present within \code{fGroups} (\emph{i.e.} because
  it has been subset afterwards) will not be reported.

  The \code{topMost}, \code{topMostByRGroup} and \code{onlyPresent} \link[=EICParams]{EIC parameters} may be ignored,
  \emph{e.g.}, when generating overview plots.
}
\section{Parallelization}{
 \code{reportHTML} uses multiprocessing to parallelize
  computations. Please see the parallelization section in the handbook for
  more details and \link[=patRoon-package]{patRoon options} for configuration
  options.

 Currently, \code{reportHTML} only uses \code{"classic"} multiprocessing, regardless of the
  \option{patRoon.MP.method} option.
